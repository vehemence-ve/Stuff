        <h2><u><b>Day One</b></u></h2>
        <p><b>Hello, Mortals.</b></p>
        <p><b>Hello there, mortals. Welcome to whatever this “blog” thing is supposed to be. My son, Kevin, insisted I start one because, apparently, my life is “super interesting and totally worth sharing.” Personally, I think my life’s about as exciting as watching lava harden, but if it makes him happy, fine.</b></p>

        <p><b>Oh, right — introductions. I’m Vehemence, Sin of Wrath, Ruler of the Wrathful Cities, and general keeper of all things loud, violent, and molten. And before you ask — yes, that Wrath. No, I don’t know your cousin’s exorcist.</b></p>

        <p><b>Kevin, my son, is sixteen and my heir to the throne. You might be thinking, “But wait, you’re immortal! Why retire?” Because, my dear mortals, immortality doesn’t mean I enjoy spending eternity on paperwork and demon HR meetings. I’ve been King long enough to know that ruling Hell is just eternal customer service with more fire.</b></p>

        <h3><u><b>My Day</b></u></h3>

        <h4><u><b>Morning</b></u></h4>
        <p><b>I don’t sleep — perks of being a Sin — so I spent most of the night handling administrative duties. When morning came, I decided to relax for once, but then ding! Meeting time with the siblings.</b></p>

        <p><b>You’d think after a few eons we’d have figured out how to hold a meeting without yelling. But no — it’s the same every time. Pride talks too much, Envy interrupts, and Sloth’s probably napping in a corner. Shockingly, it went smoothly today. We mostly renewed a few soul contracts and argued over borderlines no one actually cares about. Bureaucracy, even in Hell.</b></p>

        <h4><u><b>Afternoon</b></u></h4>
        <p><b>Once I got back to the Wrathful Cities, I checked in with the generals. Surprise, surprise — two demons were fighting over a lava pit the size of a mortal backyard. I let them duel it out. Keeps morale up.</b></p>

        <p><b>Meanwhile, Kevin said he was “going to the mortal realm to study human culture.” Which is code for “he’s hitting a drive-thru again.” Last time he came back with a milkshake and said it “changed his life.” Kid, you live in Hell. Nothing’s cold here.</b></p>

        <h4><u><b>Evening</b></u></h4>
        <p><b>Evening was quiet — relatively speaking. The souls in the pits were screaming louder than usual, so I turned down the temperature. I’m not going soft; I just hate background noise.</b></p>

        <p><b>Kevin came back bragging about his “followers.” I don’t get it. Mortals actually enjoy being followed? Down here, that usually ends with screaming and fire. But I smiled, nodded, and pretended to understand “content creation.” Parenting win.</b></p>

        <h4><u><b>Closing Thoughts</b></u></h4>
        <p><b>So, that was my day. Ruling Hell: 1% glory, 99% maintenance. But I’ll admit — it’s not boring.</b></p>

        <p><b>Maybe this “blogging” thing will be a decent outlet. If you mortals actually enjoy hearing about my infernal nonsense, congratulations — you’re probably bound here anyway.</b></p>

        <p><b>Until next time, behave yourselves… or don’t. I’ve got plenty of room down here either way.</b></p>
